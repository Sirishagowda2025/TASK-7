# 🛍️ Task 7 – Basic Sales Summary using SQL + Python + Matplotlib

This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task** where the objective is to build a basic sales summary using **SQL inside Python**, and visualize the results using **Matplotlib**.

---

## 📘 Problem Statement

Create a SQLite database and extract sales insights using SQL queries within Python. Display the output both via `print` statements and a **simple bar chart**. This is a fundamental task for understanding how SQL and Python work together for data analysis.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **SQLite3** – built-in Python SQL engine
- **Pandas** – for handling dataframes
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting charts
- **Google Colab** – for executing everything in the cloud

## 💾 Dataset Details

The sales data simulates transactions from a fictional store with the following schema:

| Column   | Type     | Description                |
|----------|----------|----------------------------|
| id       | INTEGER  | Unique sale ID             |
| product  | TEXT     | Name of the product sold   |
| quantity | INTEGER  | Quantity sold              |
| price    | INTEGER  | Price per unit (in ₹ INR)  |

The dataset is manually created and inserted into a SQLite table named `sales`. Each row represents a product sale with:
- `product` (name)
- `quantity` (units sold)
- `price` (per unit)

### 🧪 Sample Data used for task

| Product     | Quantity | Price |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Smartwatch  | 2        | 5000  |
| Headphones  | 3        | 3000  |
| Hoodie      | 5        | 1200  |
| Sneakers    | 4        | 2500  |
| Smartwatch  | 1        | 5000  |
| Hoodie      | 2        | 1200  |

## 📊 Chart Highlights:

-📱 Smartwatch generated the highest revenue
-👕 Hoodie had the highest quantity sold, but lower unit price
-🎧 Headphones and 👟 Sneakers showed good performance

## 📌 Skills Demonstrated
-Creating and modifying SQLite tables with Python
-Writing and executing SQL queries using sqlite3
-Loading SQL results into Pandas DataFrames
-Visualizing business insights using Matplotlib
-Clear storytelling through charts and tables
